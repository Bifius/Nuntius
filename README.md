# Nuntius
This is a simple account-based messenger hybrid app for Android, IOS and Windows Phone.

Nuntius is built with Ionic 3 and is intended to connect to a MySQL server via a PHP RESTful API on an Apache2 webserver.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
All files and directories other than <code>backend & database stuff</code> belong to the Ionic application whilst this directory contains the database structure and the <code>index.php</code> file which should replace the <code>index.php</code> file in the <code>api</code> directory of the <code>PHP-Slim-Restful</code> framework which should be located at <code>/var/www/</code> on your linux server. Just configure the <code>config.php</code> file (which is required by the <code>index.php</code> file) according to your needs.
You can clone the <code>PHP-Slim-Restful</code> framework from the following URL: <code>https://github.com/srinivastamada/PHP-Slim-Restful.git</code>.
